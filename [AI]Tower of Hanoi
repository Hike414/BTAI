% Base case: Move one disk directly
hanoi(1, Source, Destination, _) :-
    format('Move disk from ~w to ~w~n', [Source, Destination]).
% Recursive case: Move N disks
hanoi(N, Source, Destination, Temp) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,
    hanoi(M, Source, Temp, Destination),       % Step 1: Move N-1 disks to Temp
    hanoi(1, Source, Destination, _),          % Step 2: Move the largest disk to Destination
    hanoi(M, Temp, Destination, Source).       % Step 3: Move N-1 disks to Destination
